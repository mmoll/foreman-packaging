httparty \- query web services and examine the resulting output

[description]
`httparty' is a command-line tool to query
query web services and examine the resulting output. By default
it will output the response as a pretty-printed Ruby object (useful for
grokking the structure of output). This can also be overridden to output
formatted XML or JSON.

[example]
httparty "http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.json"
